Credit Card Fraud Detection Project
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a highly imbalanced dataset of transactions made by European cardholders. The model is designed to minimize false positives (non-fraudulent transactions classified as fraudulent) while accurately identifying fraudulent transactions.

-Project Goals
Identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.
Minimize false positives to avoid disruptions for legitimate customers.
Handle imbalanced data effectively through preprocessing techniques.
Develop a robust model and deploy it for real-world use cases.
